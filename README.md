# DBAddin
Excel Addin that allows you to retrieve Data via userdefined functions (DBListfetch, DBRowFetch and DBSetQuery) into Excel Worksheets and writing/updating Data in Excel Worksheets (DBModifications: DBMapper, DBAction and DBSequences)

Currently this is still work in progress, the migration from the VB6 Code to VB.Net is not finished completely!
