DBAddin is a ExcelDNA based Add-in for Database interoperability:
* DB Functions for database querying 
* a mapping mechanism (DBMappers) to save data to DB Tables.  
* Database Actions to be executed on the Database (DBActions)
* Sequences of DBMappers and DBActions (DBSequences)

DB Functions are an alternative to the Excel built-in MSQuery, which is integrated statically into the worksheet and has some limitations in terms of querying possibilities and flexibility of constructing parameterized queries (MS-Query allows parameterized queries only in simple queries that can be displayed graphically).  

Other useful functions for easier creation of queries and working with database data are included as well.
