# DB Addin API Documentation

DBAddin is a ExcelDNA based Add-in for Database interoperability (DB Functions for database querying and a mapping to save data to DB Tables are provided).  

DB Functions are an alternative to the Excel built-in MSQuery, which is integrated statically into the worksheet and has some limitations in terms of querying possibilities and flexibility of constructing parameterized queries (MS-Query allows parameterized queries only in simple queries that can be displayed graphically).  

DB Functions also include the possibility for filling "data bound" controls (ComboBoxes and Listboxes) with data from queries.  

Other useful functions for easier creation of queries and working with database data are included as well.
